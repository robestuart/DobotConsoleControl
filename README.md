# DobotConsoleControl
This project is to create a command line interface for use with a Dobot Magician Robotic Arm and an Arduino to perform lithographic cryoprinting.

# Installation
This program only works on Windows systems.
The simplest method to install is clone the `/DobotControllerInstallation/` folder and execute the setup.exe
Some dependencies may be necessary to use the Dobot by itself and should be downloaded directly from their website: https://www.dobot.cc/downloadcenter/dobot-magician.html
